# Lucena Store

This is a prototype for the soon-to-be-released store page for Lucena Research.

Please note that this app is still in development, and you will probably find random bugs crawling around.

Known bugs:

1. There is no mechanism to stop quantities going below zero on cart items

The technolgies I'm using are React, with the Context API methodology to manipulate State.

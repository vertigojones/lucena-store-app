# Lucena Store

This is a prototype for the soon-to-be-released store page for Lucena Research.

Please note that this app is still in development, and you will probably find random bugs crawling around.

Current bugs:

1. You can keep adding the same item to the cart.
2. The quantity buttons only work on first marketplace item.

The technolgies I'm using are React, with the Context API methodology to manipulate State.
